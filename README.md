Option 1: Grade part 01 as presented. 

01: 
01a:  01_a_MLP_Bandwaves.ipynb
	⁃	Loaded Mat files and created CSV’s. Csvs will be saved into the same directory. 
	⁃	Read the saved Csv’s and did spectral analysis and created new dataset. 
	⁃	MLP model

01b: 01_b_Classifiers_FromCSV_XGBoost_RF_SVM_DT.ipynb
In this part, the CSV’s generated per channel are imported from part 1a. Then, it is normalized and loaded into different classifiers like SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP and DT using sklearn library.

02: Optional:
This is the first notebook where I did before part 01. This is independent from part 01. Submitted in case you like to review it.
1. Normalization on Raw data
2. PCA pre-processing.
3. Created new dataset using tensor flow.
4. Coded MLP model.

The notebook takes one hour to run 150 epochs. It is not mentioned in paper; just added for your review in case.

Thank you!
